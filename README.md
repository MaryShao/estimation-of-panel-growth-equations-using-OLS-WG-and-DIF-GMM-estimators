# Estimation-of-panel-growth-equations-using-OLS-WG-and-DIF-GMM-estimators

We propose to analyze the effect of income inequality using the Gini coefficient.

The objective of this paper is to test the hypothesis of conditional convergence among Chinese provinces, 
evaluate the relationship between income inequality and economic growth, and analyze whether the convergence
is related to income inequality. We propose to analyze the effect of income inequality using the Gini coefficient. 
The analysis covers thirty-one Chinese provinces from 1997 to 2017 and is based on the estimation of panel growth 
equations using OLS, WG and DIF-GMM estimators. 

Three main results can be drawn from our empirical investigations. 
 * Firstly, conditional convergence exists among Chinese provinces and controlling other similar characteristics,
   poorer provinces growth faster than the richer ones. 
 * Secondly, the estimator of the Gini coefficients does not show a significant relationship between income inequality
   and growth. It can only suggest that higher inequality seems to lower growth.
 * Thirdly, in stable income inequality or increasing trends of inequality, we do not see the evidence of convergence; 
   while, in a period of declining income inequality, we can detect a significant absolute convergence result. 

Further study is needed to test the causality between convergence and trending of income inequality.

I would like to offer my sincerest gratitude to my course instructor Prof. Trien T. Nguyen and 
my essay supervisor Prof. Pierre Chauss√©. Without their unconditional support and insightful feedback, 
none of this would have been possible. Words cannot express how appreciative I am for everything they have done. 
I am deeply thankful to have learned a tremendous amount from them.
